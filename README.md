## Features

We operate on square mazes which start at the top left and terminate at the bottom right. The simulator has 4 main
 features:
- Maze Generation: generate random square mazes of arbitrary size (with some constraints) based on an algorithm from
Wikipedia
- Maze Solving: animate the shortest path or first path solution, starting from the top left corner, or the
user's current position 
- Editable Canvas: can remove walls with right-click and place them with left-click
- Controllable Character: the user can control a character to traverse and manually solve the maze, with options to
spice up the game. The goal is to complete the maze in the shortest possible time
- Data Persistence: the user can save and load their data

## Motivation

When I was first learning to code, I made a very primitive maze game for fun. After studying recursive traversal of 
graphs in an intro CS class, I was inspired to redo this old project from scratch using the new skills I have picked up
over the past few years. The maze game was *very* simple (just a hardcoded maze that you could walk around in, with a
GUI). The scope of this project is larger - I have added a lot of features that I dreamed 
about when I made the first game and this time I have unit tests :)
